# MyReads Project

This is a functional version of the MyReads Project, which allows you to keep track of books within your browser. Books can be assigned to different "shelves" based on their status ("Currently Reading," "Want to Read," "Read"). Searching for books is also available but limited to specific terms found in SEARCH_TERMS.md document. Also, books on the search page can be added to shelves if they are assigned a status.  

## Installing and Launching MyReads Project

Navigate to the project folder in command prompt and run "npm install."
 
After installation, type "npm start" while in the same folder and your default browser will load the MyReads app.
